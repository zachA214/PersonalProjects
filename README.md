### Why a website?
Although a website wasn't directly connected to my degree or goals for the industry, it does show that I am able to learn new things quickly and actually create with what I've learned.
    <br> <br>
## Main Page
The idea for the main page was to introduce myself in a very clear and concise way, I added a background of my university, Wasington State University, to add more connection with myself.
    <br>
### Main Page - Side Bar
I wanted to have a clean way to toggle between pages, so on my main page I added a side bar which would open up when hovered over and allow the user to jump between different html files; Unfortunately due to it requiring mouse hovering, the website is currently unable to work with mobile devices or touch screens.<br>
Using the z-axis of the objects in the page I was able to make it so that the screen darkens when hovering over the side bar.
