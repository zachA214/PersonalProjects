## How to run
In order to run the code you can either click <a href="https://zacha214.github.io/PersonalProjects/main.html" target='_blank'>here</a> OR download it into an IDE like VSCode and then run it using extensions that allow you to run in browser.

### Why a website?
Although a website wasn't directly connected to my degree or goals for the industry, it does show that I am able to learn new things quickly and actually create with what I've learned.
    <br> <br>
## Main Page
The idea for the main page was to introduce myself in a very clear and concise way, I added a background of my university, Wasington State University, to add more connection with myself.
    <br>
### Main Page - Side Bar
I wanted to have a clean way to toggle between pages, so on my main page I added a side bar which would open up when hovered over and allow the user to jump between different html files; Unfortunately due to it requiring mouse hovering, the website is currently unable to work with mobile devices or touch screens.<br>
Using the z-axis of the objects in the page I was able to make it so that the screen darkens when hovering over the side bar.

## Magic 8 Ball
I wanted to attempt to make some sort of web "game", and I attempted more difficult ones like tic tac toe and snake, but I found myself struggling to even start without a lot of guidence. Eventually I settled on the 8 ball because it only required a few things; A randomizer, changing the displayed ball, and user input. I used some basic javascript, which I had to do a lot of independent research for as I do not have that much experience with it. I then created my magic 8 ball designs in microsoft paint because I didn't want to risk using one that wasn't royalty free.

### Magic 8 Ball - Background + Buttons
The background I just found online under "royalty free game background" because I thought the plain white was boring. I added a play button which would grey out and not let you click again until the ball had rolled. I did that by making two buttons, and have them shift in and out of visiblity based on what I needed at the time. And I added an exit button to return to the main page.

## Clock

## GitHub Link
Instead of cramming in more random projects, I felt like the best way to round together my website was to connect it directly back to my github page so that anyone could explore other personal projects I have done or just look at my page.
