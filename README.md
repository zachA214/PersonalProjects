# Windows Keylogger
This Branch was created on <strong>3/27/2024</strong> at <strong>2:32pm</strong>.

# Goals
Create a keylogger that takes a users keystrokes and writes the result to a txt file
<br>
Potentially adding encryption to my txt file so it cant just be read raw
<br>

# Documentation

## How to run
You must download the code to run it, and then your keystrokes will begin to be read, press ESC to close the keylogger
    <br>
### Why a keylogger?
I have a passion for learning security and IT related things, and a keylogger seemed like the perfect starter program to make to get familiar with coding in the security space
    <br> 
### What doesn't get read?
Currently the function keys, control, capslock, alt and hotkeys (alt, pageup, pagedown, etc.)
